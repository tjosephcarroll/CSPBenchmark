# CSPBenchmark
The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the parameters which affect the 
performance of the CSP Gateway.
Overall Goals: 
  * Design a simple and scientific test (or tests) to get meaningful data
  * Investigating different parameters and how they effect the performance of the CSP Gateway. Including, but not limited to
    * Webserver - Apache/IIS/nginx
    * OS
    * CSP gateway settings
    * Web server settings
  * Have fun.

Currently under development and subject to change, but the plan is to write the driver/test framework in ruby using wrk. https://github.com/wg/wrk
